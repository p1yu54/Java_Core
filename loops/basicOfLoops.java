         *   There are two types of loops in java
         *          a. Entry controlled loops
         *          b. Exit controlled loops 
         *          
         * 
         *      1. Entry controlled loops:-
         *                     In these loops condition given to execute the loop is checked before the loop is executed
         *                     if the condition is true then the loop is executed otherwise the loop is not executed
         * 
         *                      a. For loop
         *                      b. While Loop
         *          
         *          a.For loop:
         *                    Syntax : for(initialization(Starting of loop) ; condition(End point of the loop) ; unary operator ){
         *                                  //statement;
         *                             }
         * 
         *          b.While Loop:
         *                     Syntax : while(condition){
         *                                  //statement;
         *                                  unary operator(as per the need of the program)
         *                              }
         *      
         *      2. Exit Controlled loops:-
         *                         In those the loop is executed once before the condition given is checked and if after the condtion
         *                         is true the loop will execute till the condtion is achieved of if is false the loop will no longer
         *                         run.
         * 
         *          a. Do-While Loop:   
         *                Syntax : do{
         *                              //statement
         *                              unary operator(as per the need of the program)            
         *                         }                                                 
         *                         while(condition);                                   
         *
